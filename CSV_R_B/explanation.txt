these files will serve as the training data for multinomial HMM. It should be a bit easier to train,
which is why I am also training on barlines and rests, but it only takes input of equal lengths, so 
I have had to re-analyse the pieces. The length of the notes is formatted in the same way, but the 
rests are formatted as negative numbers, and barlines represented by the string 'B'.
